#### **1. Databricks workspace**:
At the top of the architecture is the Databricks workspace, which serves as the user interface for interacting with the platform. It provides an interactive
environment where users can perform data engineering, analytics, and AI workloads using a variety of languages, such as Python, SQL, R, and Scala. The workspace
offers a range of services, including notebooks for development, dashboards for visualizing data, and workflow management tools for orchestrating data pipelines.

#### **2. Data governance with Unity Catalog**:
At the core of the Databricks lakehouse architecture is Unity Catalog, which provides a centralized data governance solution across all data and AI assets. Unity
Catalog is designed to secure and manage data access across the Databricks environment, ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.
This layer is crucial for maintaining data security, integrity, and compliance across the lakehouse platform.

#### **3. Databricks Runtime**:
Databricks Runtime is a pre-configured virtual machine image optimized for use within Databricks clusters. It includes a set of core components, such as Apache
Spark, Delta Lake, and other essential system libraries. Delta Lake enhances traditional data lakes by providing transactional guarantees similar to those found in
operational databases, thereby ensuring improved data reliability and consistency.

#### **4. Cloud infrastructure**:
At the foundation of the Databricks lakehouse architecture lies the cloud infrastructure layer. Databricks is a multi-cloud platform, meaning it is available on
major cloud service providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This layer is responsible for providing the
underlying hardware resources that Databricks accesses on behalf of users. It enables the provisioning of essential components, such as storage, networking, and the
virtual machines (VMs) or nodes that form the backbone of a computing cluster running Databricks Runtime.
