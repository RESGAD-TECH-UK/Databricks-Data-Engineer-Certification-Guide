# Relational Entities in Databricks

### Databases in Databricks
In Databricks, a database essentially corresponds to a schema in a data catalog. This means that when you create a database, youâ€™re essentially defining a logical structure where tables, views, and functions can be organized. This collection of database objects is called a schema. 
You have the flexibility to create a database using either the 'CREATE DATABASE' or 'CREATE SCHEMA' syntax, as they are functionally equivalent.
